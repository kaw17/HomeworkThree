### Assignment Three
I've tried 6 times to get Cyberduck and Github to update my program to this version. Every single time it uses the old hwThree.js file. It isn't even on my computer anymore, how is it even possible for it to find that version? Please, computer, for the love of god just do the thing that makes sense instead resurrecting deleted files.
